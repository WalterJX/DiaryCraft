# DiaryCraft
This is my graduation project in undergraduate study. The name of the software was SchoolMemory at first, but was changed to DiaryCraft later.  
Though I already graduated, I am still updating this app in order to make it better. README file is also updating.

## Update Log
2/15/2020, code structure optimization. All "Presenter" classes were deleted.

## Introduction
This DiaryCraft system has the following functions:  
* Notepad functions: In addtion to basic notepad functions such as add, delete, check and edit, this system can also let user add pictures, peoples’ names, tags, dates and location coordinates in the dairy.  
* Classify and search functions: The system can classify all of the diaries according to the names and tags added in the diaries. User can search diaries using key word, date range, names and tags.  
* Picture wall functions: The system can show all the pictures in the diaries in the form of ‘waterfall’, and has basic functions like photo albums: user can click on the picture to see the origin picture, swipe left of right to see different pictures and zoom in or out.  
* Map functions: The system can show the current location of the user, and show all of the location in diaries by a red mark.
